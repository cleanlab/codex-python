    """
    Typed dict of advanced configuration options for the Trustworthy Language Model.
    Many of these configurations are determined by the quality preset selected
    (learn about quality presets in the TLM [initialization method](./#class-tlm)).
    Specifying TLMOptions values directly overrides any default values set from the
    quality preset.

    For all options described below, higher settings will lead to longer runtimes
    and may consume more tokens internally. You may not be able to run long prompts
    (or prompts with long responses) in your account, unless your token/rate limits
    are increased. If you hit token limit issues, try lower/less expensive
    TLMOptions to be able to run longer prompts/responses, or contact Cleanlab to
    increase your limits.

    The default values corresponding to each quality preset are:

    - **best:** `num_consistency_samples` = 8, `num_self_reflections` = 3,
      `reasoning_effort` = `"high"`.
    - **high:** `num_consistency_samples` = 4, `num_self_reflections` = 3,
      `reasoning_effort` = `"high"`.
    - **medium:** `num_consistency_samples` = 0, `num_self_reflections` = 3,
      `reasoning_effort` = `"high"`.
    - **low:** `num_consistency_samples` = 0, `num_self_reflections` = 3,
      `reasoning_effort` = `"none"`.
    - **base:** `num_consistency_samples` = 0, `num_self_reflections` = 1,
      `reasoning_effort` = `"none"`.

    By default, TLM uses the: "medium" `quality_preset`, "gpt-4.1-mini" base
    `model`, and `max_tokens` is set to 512. You can set custom values for these
    arguments regardless of the quality preset specified.

    Args: model ({"gpt-4.1", "gpt-4.1-mini", "gpt-4.1-nano", "o4-mini", "o3",
    "gpt-4.5-preview", "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o", "o3-mini", "o1", "o1-mini", "gpt-4",
    "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", "claude-opus-4-0", "claude-sonnet-4-0",
    "claude-3.7-sonnet", "claude-3.5-sonnet-v2", "claude-3.5-sonnet",
    "claude-3.5-haiku", "claude-3-haiku", "nova-micro", "nova-lite", "nova-pro"},
    default = "gpt-4.1-mini"): Underlying base LLM to use (better models yield
    better results, faster models yield faster results). - Models still in beta:
    "o3", "o1", "o4-mini", "o3-mini", "o1-mini", "gpt-4.5-preview",
    "claude-opus-4-0", "claude-sonnet-4-0", "claude-3.7-sonnet",
    "claude-3.5-haiku". - Recommended models for accuracy: "gpt-4.1", "o4-mini",
    "o3", "claude-opus-4-0", "claude-sonnet-4-0". - Recommended models for low
    latency/costs: "gpt-4.1-nano", "nova-micro".

        max_tokens (int, default = 512): the maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the TLM response (and in internal trustworthiness scoring).
        Higher values here may produce better (more reliable) TLM responses and trustworthiness scores, but at higher runtimes/costs.
        If you experience token/rate limit errors while using TLM, try lowering this number.
        For OpenAI models, this parameter must be between 64 and 4096. For Claude models, this parameter must be between 64 and 512.

        num_candidate_responses (int, default = 1): how many alternative candidate responses are internally generated in `TLM.prompt()`.
        `TLM.prompt()` scores the trustworthiness of each candidate response, and then returns the most trustworthy one.
        This parameter must be between 1 and 20. It has no effect on `TLM.score()`.
        Higher values here can produce more accurate responses from `TLM.prompt()`, but at higher runtimes/costs.
        When it is 1, `TLM.prompt()` simply returns a standard LLM response and does not attempt to auto-improve it.

        num_consistency_samples (int, default = 8): the amount of internal sampling to measure LLM response consistency, a factor affecting trustworthiness scoring.
        Must be between 0 and 20. Higher values produce more reliable TLM trustworthiness scores, but at higher runtimes/costs.
        Measuring consistency helps quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with
        strange prompts or prompts that are too vague/open-ended to receive a clearly defined 'good' response.
        TLM measures consistency via the degree of contradiction between sampled responses that the model considers plausible.

        num_self_reflections(int, default = 3): the number of self-reflections to perform where the LLM is asked to reflect on the given response and directly evaluate correctness/confidence.
        The maximum number of self-reflections currently supported is 3. Lower values will reduce runtimes/costs, but potentially also the reliability of trustworthiness scores.
        Reflection helps quantify aleatoric uncertainty associated with challenging prompts and catches responses that are noticeably incorrect/bad upon further analysis.

        similarity_measure ({"semantic", "string", "embedding", "embedding_large", "code", "discrepancy"}, default = "discrepancy"): how the
        trustworthiness scoring's consistency algorithm measures similarity between alternative responses considered plausible by the model.
        Supported similarity measures include - "semantic" (based on natural language inference),
        "embedding" (based on vector embedding similarity), "embedding_large" (based on a larger embedding model),
        "code" (based on model-based analysis designed to compare code), "discrepancy" (based on model-based analysis of possible discrepancies),
        and "string" (based on character/word overlap). Set this to "string" for minimal runtimes/costs.

        reasoning_effort ({"none", "low", "medium", "high"}, default = "high"): how much internal LLM calls are allowed to reason (number of thinking tokens)
        when generating alternative possible responses and reflecting on responses during trustworthiness scoring.
        Higher reasoning efforts may yield more reliable TLM trustworthiness scores. Reduce this value to reduce runtimes/costs.

        log (list[str], default = []): optionally specify additional logs or metadata that TLM should return.
        For instance, include "explanation" here to get explanations of why a response is scored with low trustworthiness.

        custom_eval_criteria (list[dict[str, Any]], default = []): optionally specify custom evalution criteria beyond the built-in trustworthiness scoring.
        The expected input format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has the following keys:
        - name: Name of the evaluation criteria.
        - criteria: Instructions specifying the evaluation criteria.

        use_self_reflection (bool, default = `True`): deprecated. Use `num_self_reflections` instead.
